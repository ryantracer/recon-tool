# recon-script
A reconnaissance tool written in Python, i may add features in the future as i learn more, specially since i've been having fun with the scapy library.

It can scan for available ports in a network and send arp requests to a network range in order to find available hosts, although the arp method is not the most efficient and will frequently require more than one attempt to get the most out of it.

Scanning ports of a network without permission is illegal, do not try it out of your own network, this project was made for learning.
